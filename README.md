#ML-Predit-Liver-in-Indian-People

data analysis and machine learning project focused on liver patient data ,
uses the Decision Tree Classifier model from scikit-learn which is trained on the dataset to predict the presence of liver disease .


This project analyzes the Indian Liver Patient Dataset to predict the presence of liver disease in patients using machine learning techniques. the following key steps:
•	Data Exploration: The dataset is loaded and examined to understand its structure, feature distributions, and missing values.
•	Data Preparation: Necessary preprocessing steps such as handling missing values and encoding categorical variables are performed to prepare the data for modeling.
•	Model Building: A Decision Tree Classifier (using the entropy criterion) from scikit-learn is trained to classify patients as having liver disease or not. Evaluation: The trained model is evaluated using a confusion matrix and accuracy score to assess its predictive performance. This project demonstrates a typical data science pipeline, from data loading and preprocessing to model training and evaluation, and can serve as a template for similar classification tasks in healthcare analytics.
